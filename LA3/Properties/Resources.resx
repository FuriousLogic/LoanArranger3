    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="Agreement Terms and Conditions" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>By signing this agreement you agree to repay the loan plus the interest by the payments set out, by their specified dates. Payments must be made to us at the address shown, or to any person or address notified by us in writing.  Punctual payment is essential. If you pay by post you do so at your own risk.  If you already have a loan account with us, the appropriate part of the new loan will be applied in paying off the existing loan, and only the remaining balance will be paid to you.

2. FAILURE TO PAY ON TIME
We have the right to charge interest at the annual percentage rate shown (less the part attributed to any documentation fee) on all overdue amounts including any balance which may become payable under clause 3 and which remains unpaid on the date for the last payment under this agreement. This interest will be calculated on a daily basis from the date the amount falls due until it is received and will run both before and after any Judgement. We may also charge you for any legal costs and other expenses incurred by us in obtaining payment by you of any sum overdue.

We have the right to demand earlier payment of the balance of the loan and the interest by sending you a default notice under the COnsumer Credit Act. If you fail to take the action required by this notice within the time specified, the whole of the balance remaining unpaid on the agreement shall become payable immediately. You will become entitled to a rebate of part of the interest if you pay that balance before it would have become due had we not demanded earlier payment.

If you pay off the balance of this agreement before the date of which the final payment falls due you will usually be entitled to a rebate of part of the interest.
